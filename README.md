- Record the departure and arrival times of planes
- Display the flight schedule for a specific day
- Search for a specific flight based on the flight number
- Store and retrieve data from text files
- User-friendly GUI created using GTK3+ Library
- Uses Linked-Lists as a Data Structure to manipulate lists of objects

## Requirements
- C compiler
- GTK3+ Library
